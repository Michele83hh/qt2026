      "explanation": "Controller-based networking (such as Software-Defined Networking or SDN) provides centralized management and programmability of the network. The controller has a complete view of the network and can make intelligent decisions about traffic flow, policy enforcement, and resource allocation. This approach separates the control plane (decision making) from the data plane (packet forwarding), making networks more flexible, automated, and easier to manage at scale compared to traditional distributed networking models.",

It does this by sending out an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation message and listening for a response. If a response is received, then it means that another device is already using this address.",

The 'ipv6 address autoconfigure' command tells the router to use either SLAAC or stateless DHCPv6 to configure its global unicast address. The 'ipv6 dhcp server' command is used on a router that is running a DHCPv6 server to indicate what address information should be served to clients.",

      "explanation": "Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) can be used as an alternative to DHCPv6. In this approach, a router provides global routing prefix, prefix length, default gateway, and DNS server information to a host. The host is not provided with a global unicast address by SLAAC. Instead, SLAAC suggests that the host create its own global unicast address based on the supplied global routing prefix. ARP is not used in IPv6. ICMPv6 messages are used by SLAAC to provide addressing and other configuration information. EUI-64 is a process in which a host will create an Interface ID from its 48-bit MAC address.",

      "explanation": "The default gateway is the IP address of an interface on the router on the same network as the sending host. Looking at the router configuration, the Payroll LAN is connected to the router via the gi0/0 interface with IP address 10.27.14.148 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. When a host needs to communicate with remote networks, it must send packets to the default gateway (the router interface) on the same local network. Therefore, the default gateway address configured on the new host should be 10.27.14.148, which is the IP address of the router interface on the Payroll LAN.",

It’s the opposite of SYN; it says, \"I have no more\ndata to send, let's close this session.\"</li><li>RST (Reset):&nbsp;This is used when a\nconnection needs to be closed&nbsp;abruptly&nbsp;or if a device receives\na packet for a connection that doesn't exist. It’s a way of saying,\n\"Something is wrong, kill this connection immediately.\"</li><li>PSH (Push):&nbsp;This flag tells the\nreceiving device to pass the data to the application layer&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;rather\nthan waiting for the buffer to fill up. It is used during data transfer, not during the initial\nhandshake.</li><li>URG\n(Urgent):&nbsp;This\nindicates that certain data within the segment is urgent and should be\nprocessed before other data. Like PSH, this is used during the actual exchange\nof data, not to set up the connection.</li></ul>",

      "explanation": "The default gateway is the IP address of a router interface on the same network segment as the sending host. This interface serves as the exit point for any traffic destined to remote networks that are not on the local network. Looking at the router configuration for the Floor router, the Registrar LAN is connected to the router via interface gi0/1 with an IP address of 192.168.235.234 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. When a new host is added to the Registrar LAN and needs to communicate with remote networks (such as the Manager LAN, ISP, or Head Office WAN), it must be configured with the default gateway IP address that corresponds to the router interface on that same network. This ensures that any packets destined for remote networks are forwarded to the router for proper routing. Therefore, the default gateway for the new host on the Registrar LAN should be configured as 192.168.235.234, which is the IP address of the Floor router's gi0/1 interface (the gateway interface on the Registrar LAN).",

Accurate time synchronization is crucial for correlating log entries across multiple devices, certificate validation, and time-based access control. NTP uses a hierarchical system of time sources called strata, where stratum 0 devices are atomic clocks or GPS clocks, stratum 1 devices sync with stratum 0, and so on. NTP uses UDP port 123.",

When a client wants to establish a secure remote connection to a server using SSH, it must send the initial connection request to port 22 on the destination server. Port 22 is a well-known port (in the range 0-1023) that is reserved specifically for SSH connections. Port 69 is used for TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), port 67 is used for DHCP servers, and port 80 is used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Each network service has its own designated port number that allows the server to properly route incoming connection requests to the correct service or application.",

      "explanation": "<b>Explanation:</b>\nThe <b>extended ping</b> command (initiated by typing ping and pressing Enter in privileged EXEC mode) allows an administrator to specify parameters that are not available in a standard ping.By default, when a router originates a ping, it uses the IP address of the <b>exit interface</b> as the source. In this scenario, the administrator wants to verify connectivity from the perspective of the interface that H3 uses (the Gateway interface on R2). By using an <b>extended ping</b>, the admin can:<ul><li>Manually set the <b>Source address or interface</b> to R2's LAN interface (H3's gateway).</li><li>Verify if R1 (and the path to H1) has a valid <b>return route</b> to that specific subnet.</li><li>Prove that R2 is correctly routing traffic originating from the H3 network segment.</li></ul>If a standard ping from R2 to H1 succeeds but an extended ping sourced from the H3-facing interface fails, it typically indicates a routing issue (e.g., a missing return route on a downstream router) rather than a configuration error on R2's local interfaces.<b>Incorrect Options:</b><ul><li><b>traceroute:</b> Useful for finding where a packet is dropped along a path, but by default, it also uses the exit interface IP and doesn't inherently \"prove\" the source-specific configuration as effectively as a sourced ping.</li><li><b>show cdp neighbors:</b> This is a Layer 2 discovery tool. While it proves physical and data-link connectivity to directly connected Cisco devices, it cannot test end-to-end Layer 3 reachability to host H1.</li><li><b>telnet:</b> Used for remote management or testing if a specific TCP port is open. It does not provide the granular source-interface control needed to simulate H3's traffic path in this specific context.</li></ul>",

It is essential for troubleshooting name resolution issues. Key features include:<ul><li><b>Manual Querying:</b> Unlike passive resolution, nslookup allows a user to enter a hostname and receive the specific IP address mapped to it directly from the configured DNS server.</li><li><b>Interactive and Non-interactive Modes:</b> You can run a single query (e.g., nslookup cisco.com) or enter an interactive shell to perform multiple lookups or change query types (like MX or NS records).</li><li><b>Server Specification:</b> You can manually specify which DNS server to query by adding the server's IP after the hostname (e.g., nslookup cisco.com 8.8.8.8), which helps verify if a specific server is providing correct or updated records.</li></ul><b>Incorrect Options:</b><ul><li><b>ipconfig /displaydns:</b> This command is used to view the <b>local DNS resolver cache</b> on a Windows machine. It shows what has already been resolved recently, but it does not send a new query to a DNS server.</li><li><b>tracert:</b> This utility is used to trace the path packets take to a destination. While it may trigger a DNS lookup to show the names of the routers (hops) along the path, its primary purpose is measuring latency and identifying routing bottlenecks, not querying DNS records.</li><li><b>net:</b> The net command suite (e.g., net use, net start) is used for managing network resources, users, and services in a Windows environment, but it does not have host-name resolution or DNS querying capabilities.</li></ul>",

      "explanation": "The purpose of an ARP request is to find the MAC address of the destination host on an Ethernet LAN. The ARP process sends a Layer 2 broadcast to all devices on the Ethernet LAN. The frame contains the IP address of the destination and the broadcast MAC address, FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. The host with the IP address that matches the IP address in the ARP request will reply with a unicast frame that includes the MAC address of the host.

The administrator sends a request for the IP address for the end device in school B and the response is 192.168.25.10. Neither school is using a VPN. The administrator knows immediately that this IP will not work. Why?",

Spyware differs from other types of malicious software: DoS (Denial of Service) Attack: An attack that slows or crashes a device or network service Identity Theft: The use of stolen credentials to access private data Firewall: A network device that filters access and traffic coming into a network (this is a protective device, not a threat) The key characteristic of spyware is that it operates silently in the background, collecting sensitive user information such as browsing history, passwords, personal data, or financial information, without the user's awareness or permission.",

The port security feature can limit the number of dynamically learned MAC addresses per port or allow only known valid NICs to be connected via their specific MAC addresses. The DHCP snooping feature can identify the legitimate DHCP servers and block fake DHCP servers from issuing IP address information. These two features can help fight against DHCP attacks.",
